# This repository is used for coding interview preperation. I will go over all concepts,topics and design patterns in order to adequately prepare for my interviews.



## Algorithms


### Algorithm: follows a certain guideline, set of steps to finish a task

We cultivate algorithmic thinking, choosing the best algorithm for the task.

Main Question: What solution works best for the current problem ?

There are several examples of searching and sorting algorithms such as 

### Linear Search
an example set of steps would be e.g)
1) Start at the beginning
2) Move sequentially 
3) Compare current value to target 
4)  Reach end of List

### Insertion sort
### binary Search
### bubble Sort


## How To tackle an algorithm:
1) we define a clear problem statement(how the input is defined, and what the output looks like when the algorithm is done)
2) we have a specific order of steps
3) Each step to be explicitly clear, each step to be distinct(not misinterpreted)
4) Produce a Result
5) Algorithm to be completed in a finite amount of time



Time Complexity: How long it takes the algorithm to run.
Space Complexity: Amount of memory taken.



### Tackling problem using binary search algorithm
1) Problem Statement: We are looking to find the target number in an array of numbers 1 --> 100, the input being the target number. The Algorithm is done when we reach the target number.
