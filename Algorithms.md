# Algorithms


Algorithm: follows a certain guideline, set of steps to finish a task

We cultivate algorithmic thinking, choosing the best algorithm for the task.

Main Question: What solution works best for the current problem ?

There are several examples of searching and sorting algorithms such as 

# Linear Search
an example set of steps would be e.g)
1) Start at the beginning
2) Move sequentially 
3) Compare current value to target 
4)  Reach end of List

# Insertion sort
# binary Search
# bubble Sort


# How To tackle an algorithm:
1) we define a clear problem statement(how the input is defined, and what the output looks like when the algorithm is done)
2) we have a specific order of steps
3) Each step to be explicitly clear, each step to be distinct(not misinterpreted)
4) Produce a Result
5) Algorithm to be completed in a finite amount of time
